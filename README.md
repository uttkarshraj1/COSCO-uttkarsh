COSCO is an AI based coupled-simulation and container orchestration framework for integrated Edge, Fog and Cloud Computing Environments. It's a simple python based software solution, where academics or practitioners can develop, simulate, test and deploy their scheduling policies. Further, this repo presents a novel gradient-based optimization strategy using deep neural networks as surrogate functions and co-simulations to facilitate decision making. A tutorial of the COSCO framework was presented at the International Conference of Performance Engineering (ICPE) 2022. Recording available [here](https://youtu.be/osjpaNmkm_w).

## Advantages of Multi_Simulation technique
1. Hassle free development of AI based scheduling algorithms in integrated edge, fog and cloud infrastructures.

## Novel Scheduling Algorithms
We present two 

## Quick Start Guide
To run the Multi_Simulation/Single_Simulation  technique , install required packages using
python3 install.py

To run the code with the required scheduler, modify line 106 of `main.py` to one of the several options Single_Simulation, Multiple_Simulation
''

scheduler = Multiple_Simulation()

''
To run the simulator, use the following command
python3 main.py
